## 2. Licenses
### 2.1. Copyright License.
You grant to Nord Security, and those who receive Contributions directly or indirectly from Nord Security, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, communicate to the public, translate, adapt, arrange, alter, or otherwise use Your Contribution(s), without compensation, without any obligation to report on such use, and without any other restriction, and to sublicense any or all of the foregoing rights to third parties.

### 2.2. Patent License.
You grant to Nord Security, and those who receive Contributions directly or indirectly from Nord Security, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this Section below) license to make, have made, transfer, offer to sell, sell, import, dispose or otherwise use Your Contribution(s), in whole or in part, without compensation, without any obligation to report on such use, and without any other restriction, and to sublicense any or all of the foregoing rights to third parties, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Open-Source Project or other material in which such Contribution(s) is used. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, any Open-Source Project to which you have contributed, or other material in which such Contribution(s) is used, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

### 2.3. Other Rights Reserved.

## 3. Your Employer.
References to *“Employer”* in this Agreement include Your employer or anyone else for whom You are acting in submitting Your Contribution, e.g., as a contractor, vendor, or agent. If Your Contribution is submitted in the course of Your work for an Employer, or Your Employer has intellectual property rights in Your Contribution by contract or applicable law, You must secure permission from Your Employer to submit the Contribution before concluding this Agreement. In that case, the term *“You”* in this Agreement will refer to You and the Employer collectively. If You change Employer in the future and desire to submit additional Contributions for the new Employer, then You agree to sign a new Contributor License Agreement and secure permission from the new Employer before submitting those Contributions.
