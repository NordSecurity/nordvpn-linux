# Security Policy

## Supported versions

We support the last 3 minor app versions.
For example, if 3.15.5 is the latest version, the supported versions are:
- 3.15.5, 3.15.4, 3.15.3, 3.15.2, 3.15.1, 3.15.0
- 3.14.2, 3.14.1, 3.14.0
- 3.13.0

All supported versions can be found in official [deb](https://repo.nordvpn.com/deb/nordvpn/debian/pool/main/) and [rpm](https://repo.nordvpn.com/yum/nordvpn/centos/x86_64/Packages/n/) repositories.
Once a new minor version comes out, the oldest one is removed from the repositories.
