* Big news - NordVPN now has a graphical interface on Linux! It's the same trusted app, with the same rock-solid security - just way easier to use. Click, connect, and stay protected in seconds. Right out of the box, you'll get light and dark mode, post-quantum encryption, and our latest NordWhisper technology. At the same time, the command-line version remains fully supported, with Meshnet still exclusive to the CLI.
