The [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/features/) Linux application provides a simple and user-friendly command line interface for accessing all the different features of NordVPN.
Users can choose from a list of server locations around the world, or let the application automatically select the best server for them.
They can also customize their connection settings, such as choosing a specific protocol or enabling the kill switch feature.

The application manages:
- network interfaces with the help of [tuntap](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.0/source/Documentation/networking/tuntap.rst) kernel interface,
- firewall with the help of [iptables](https://www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/index.html),
- routing with the help of [iproute2](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/networking/iproute2) and
- DNS with the help of [systemd-resolved](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-resolved.service.html).
