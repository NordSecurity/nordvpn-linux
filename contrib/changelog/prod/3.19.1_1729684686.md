* This update may not bring visible changes, and that's okay. We've been tweaking things under the hood to ensure your NordVPN app runs smoother than ever. It's the invisible work that often makes the biggest difference.
* Several weird and rare bugs popped in for a surprise visit. We've taken care of them - end of story.
* We've upgraded the library that powers file sharing via Meshnet. Keep the app up to date on all peer devices to avoid compatibility issues when sending files.
