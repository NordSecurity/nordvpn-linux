* Meshnet is leaving NordVPN on October 1. If you've relied on it, we know this may be frustrating, but we're not taking it lightly. To give you time to plan ahead, we're sharing this news early. You'll also get a reminder message in the app.
* Restoring default settings no longer logs you out or turns off Kill Switch — but now you can choose those options if you want. Use these commands: 'nordvpn set defaults --logout' or 'nordvpn set defaults --off killswitch'
* Fixed: We discovered DNS resolution wouldn't work correctly with NordWhisper. That bug has left the building.
* Remote config now comes through a CDN. What does that mean for you? Your app gets tweaks and improvements faster.
* We upgraded OpenSSL to 3.0.17. Always nice to cross that off the list.
* HTTP/3 connections are steadier now.
* App packaging works better when nothing's missing — so we updated libxml2 and bundled SQLite properly.
* This update improves OpenVPN security. May the safety of connection be with you.
