* As quantum computing advances, so do our measures to protect your data. You can now enable post-quantum encryption against the cyber threats of the future. It’s always better to be prepared than to wish you were. Or, as they say: "Be quantum-proof." Use the command: nordvpn set pq <enable>.
* Now even more devices can run NordVPN. We’ve added support for ARM64 architecture in the Snap package.
* Performance has been optimized, bugs were kicked out, and stability is reinforced.
