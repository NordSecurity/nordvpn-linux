* Recent connections now appear in both the GUI and the tray. The app remembers so you don't have to.
* Some say joy is found in the little things. We say you can now select a connection location right from the tray. This improvement came to life thanks to the contribution from the community, and we're seriously grateful.
* Specialty servers have entered the tray. Pick one when your connection needs a little something extra.
* We added a Terms section to Settings. Now your favorite bedtime reads — terms of service, privacy policy, and other documents — are all in one place.
* Some pixels shifted. Some colors softened. The kind of changes you notice only after wondering why everything feels nicer.
* We've improved compatibility with rpm-ostree setups. Great tools deserve to work well together.
* We tracked down a rare bug that could crash the app on X11 systems. Slippery little thing. It won't be bothering anyone now.
* The tray settings menu on KDE with X11 wasn't opening. This was unfortunate because opening is more or less the core expectation of a menu.
* The app wouldn't work after installation on systems without the awk utility. Now it does.
* Installing on Red Hat didn't work properly. That wasn't very Linux of us. We have fixed the issue.
