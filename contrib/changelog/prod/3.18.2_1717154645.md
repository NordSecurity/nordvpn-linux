* Exciting news! The NordVPN Linux app is now available on the Snap Store. Installing the app on Linux has never been easier.
* If your dedicated IP subscription has expired, we’ll guide you smoothly to the subscription page. Keep that unique IP address all to yourself.
* You can now disable the tray icon directly from the tray settings. To bring it back, just run the nordvpn set tray on command.
* Fixed: A bug snuck into the last release and broke the allowlist.
* Fixed: Kill Switch and LAN discovery didn’t work nicely together after a daemon restart. All good now.
