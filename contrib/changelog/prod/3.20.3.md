* Post-quantum encryption didn't work when LAN discovery was activated. The features get along well now.
* Firewall rules related to Meshnet would persist even after turning off Meshnet. They now clear out properly.
* Allowlisting a subnet could cut off your internet. That's not exactly what we'd call a feature. So it doesn't happen anymore.
* The bug that prevented auto-connect from working with obfuscated servers is a thing of the past. May your VPN journey be smoother from here on out.
