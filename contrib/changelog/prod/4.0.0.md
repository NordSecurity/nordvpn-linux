* This update adds the new privacy consent. If you agree, we'll collect limited app performance data to help us spot issues faster and focus on features you actually need. If you say no, we'll respect your choice and only collect the essentials needed for the app to work properly. Your online activity stays private. Always.
* We'd rather add features than take them away, but IPv6 has privacy gaps we can't ignore. The technology is still vulnerable to WebRTC leaks, so we're putting its support on hold. That means the nordvpn set ipv6 command is no longer available, and IPv6 options won't appear in settings.
* We've given connection times a speed boost - because every second counts.
* A few more background improvements are in place to keep your NordVPN experience running at its best.
