* We dedicated some time to routine maintenance: refreshed the code, improved the accuracy of some error messages, caught a couple of bugs.
* NordWhisper sometimes spammed the activity logs with repeating messages. We fixed this.
* Kill Switch now correctly handles multiple network interfaces on a single device. The rule is simple: no VPN — no traffic, no exceptions.
* The LAN discovery feature did its job so well that it would take priority over Meshnet permissions. Now when you disable the local network permission for your Meshnet peer, even when enabled, LAN discovery won’t allow access to other devices on your device’s LAN.
