* The NordVPN Linux GUI app source code is now public. You can see exactly how things run behind the scenes (and maybe admire the architecture while you're there).
* Meshnet is here to stay! Over the past month, you've spoken up and reminded us just how much it can offer — not simply as a file sharing feature, but as a way to connect and collaborate. We heard you. Meshnet features will stay live and supported.
* The Snap package now includes the GUI app, and you'll see a handy screen in the interface showing which Snap commands to run after installation. We do like to keep things snappy.
* We've upgraded our internal libraries — with Encrypted Client Hello and Control Flow Guard joining the team for extra protection.
* Fixed: Sometimes firewall rules in the mangle table refused to clear, leaving connections blocked. We've persuaded them to let go.
* Some of you noticed an unusually high number of analytics requests during feature rollouts. Balance restored.
